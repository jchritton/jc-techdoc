# Speak My Language

Technical documentation for those who just want to know "how do I do the thing, but in a different programming language?"

The excellent resource [DevDocs](https://www.devdocs.io) is great for diving into and searching for different libraries and methods, but unfortunately all documentation is not matched up. This means that it's not always clear how to do *this* in *that* language from a practical standpoint. Speak My Language is an attempt to remedy that problem, born out of my initial desire to understand how to better translate my existing JavaScript skills to Java.
